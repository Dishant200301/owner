                    1. Owner is building Shopify for local business owners,
                    starting with restaurant owners.
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    The fate of every business is being determined by its online
                    presence. Consumers make their offline buying decisions
                    online. That’s a problem for local business owners. They
                    need high-conversion websites, loyalt =""y programs, and
                    great digital marketing. Compare your local restaurants’
                    websites to Domino’s or Sweetgreen: you’ll see just how far
                    they’re falling behind. Shopify solved this problem for
                    e-commerce businesses. Owner is solving it for local
                    businesses, starting with restaurants. Thousands of
                    restaurant owners are using Owner to create a future where
                    small business owners survive and thrive.
                  </p>

                      2. Owner is the ultimate weapon for owners to take on
                      their Goliaths.&nbsp;
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Owner isn’t another tool to figure out. It’s an opinionated
                    system that works out of the box to own the outcome of
                    profitable sales growth.<strong> </strong>Before Owner,
                    restaurants had two options: tools (“build your own
                    website!”) or consultants (“I’ll run your digital
                    marketing!”). Tools fail: they require non-technical
                    business owners to make too many technical decisions.
                    Consultants also fail: business owners can’t afford their
                    high costs. Owner succeeds because it isn’t another tool to
                    figure out. Owner is an opinionated product that rejects
                    customization. It delivers the outcome of profitable sales
                    growth, rather than being a tool in the workflow. Since
                    every digital property is consistent and controlled by
                    Owner, the platform runs millions of split tests every week.
                    It automatically optimizes every part of the system.

                    Guests on Owner websites are more than 2x as likely to place
                    an order. Restaurants on the Owner platform grow their
                    traffic by 30% on average within 30 days. Owner is the #1
                    rated restaurant tech software on both{" "}

                    Restaurant owners feel scared of economic forces. Those
                    include inflation, tariffs, and minimum wage hikes. Owner is
                    a source of stability amid the instability. Adopting Owner
                    increases their odds of surviving and growing, despite the
                    approaching threats. The macroeconomic uncertainty is
                    helping Owner grow.

                    As you’ll see in the Team section, the Owner team is already
                    formidable. For one, it’s stacked with founder DNA: more
                    than 25 team members are former founders! Many have raised
                    millions, led startups as CEOs, and are now individual
                    contributors at Owner. Others are alumni of highly relevant
                    startups including Shopify and DoorDash. Owner is proud to

                  <h2>The Problem</h2>
                  <p>
                    Local brick-and-mortar business owners are being destroyed
                    by Goliath-sized corporations. Technology has been
                    weaponized to crush and replace them.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Imagine a local pizzeria. The owner’s name is Sarkis. His
                    pizzeria is called Township Line Pizza.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    20 years ago, the wood-fired aroma was enough to bring in a
                    steady stream of hungry customers. Sarkis’ great food and
                    service kept guests coming back.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Around 2020, everything changed. The world was already
                    shifting online, but COVID-19 accelerated the transition.
                    Today, the majority of consumers find restaurants online,
                    evaluate restaurants online, and order food online. This
                    trend is here to stay; it is not going to change back.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this new world, aromas and friendly service don’t stand a
                    chance.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new world has been great for Goliath-sized corporations
                    like Domino’s. Domino’s has invested billions in tech that
                    drives online sales, loyalt =""y, and re-ordering like
                    clockwork.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Domino’s is growing while Sarkis struggles. Nobody has built
                    tech to drive his online sales like clockwork. Sarkis is
                    fighting for his business with nothing but time-consuming,
                    expensive point solutions.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  <p>He might as well be fighting with his bare hands.</p>

                  <h2>Market Size</h2>
                  <p>
                    Owner’s initial market<strong> </strong>consists of
                    independent restaurant owners in the US. That’s a $21B+/year
                    revenue opportunity: 600,000 restaurants at $35,000/year.
                    $35K is what they spend on tech and marketing.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the founding vision<strong> </strong>has always
                    stretched beyond restaurants. The vision involves
                    championing 15+ other types of local businesses. Those will
                    include hair salons, independent grocers, gyms, dog
                    groomers, spas, and auto shops. They all need the same
                    solution that Owner is building for restaurants today. So
                    the Owner team has been building with transferability in
                    mind.

                    Online ordering has boomed. Both pickup &amp; delivery have
                    risen to prominence (versus dine-in). Takeout is now
                    all-important to restaurant success. Succeeding online has
                    shifted from “nice to have” to “must have.” Restaurant
                    owners are desperate for a solution.

                  <p>
                    Stripe, Twilio, and Mailgun enable Owner to build non-core
                    functionalities using existing models. They allow Owner to
                    achieve a more powerful product. Meanwhile, competitors have
                    to build everything themselves. They’re locked into outdated
                    systems that force them to do that.

                    Minimum wage hikes are compelling restaurants to reduce

                    costs. Delivery app fees slash into restaurants’ margins.

                    online ordering.&nbsp;

                  <h2>Product</h2>
                  <p>
                    Owner’s founding product insight is that local business
                    owners don’t need another software tool to figure out. They
                    need a system that produces the outcome they’re after:
                    growing sales profitably. This is why the Owner product is{" "}
                    <strong>extremely opinionated.&nbsp;</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All small business software before Owner was built to be
                    maximally customizable. But Owner is optimizing for giving
                    customers{" "}
                    <strong>performance, not customizability.&nbsp;</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, restaurant owners can upload their logos and
                    brand colors into the Owner website generator. But they
                    can’t change the placement of CTA buttons, information
                    hierarchy, or order conversion flow. They can’t change the
                    things that dictate performance.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The universal, standardized web templates allow Owner to run
                    thousands of split-tests every single day. It’s impossible
                    to run split-tests on sites you don’t control. But since
                    Owner controls the websites, Owner can rapidly iterate to
                    improve everyone’s websites.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Owner’s customers are delighted to offload many decisions to
                    Owner with thousands of micro-decisions about their online
                    presence. It doesn’t bother them if their website resembles
                    another restaurant that also uses Owner — because they see
                    their sales growing. That’s the #1 thing owners care about.

                    Owner has already collected and organized a massive amount
                    of data. Owner's data spans thousands of restaurants,
                    millions of menu items, cuisine specifics, SEO performance,
                    ordering patterns, transaction patterns, and tens of
                    millions of people using the product.

                  <p>
                    Also, Owner’s data has already been structured into a highly
                    prescriptive battle plan for local restaurants. Owner knows
                    the single best way to grow restaurant sales. The battle
                    plan includes the correct answers for many variables.&nbsp;

                  <p>
                    Owner already implements many components of the battle plan
                    through its opinionated system. AI already fights part of
                    the battle.{" "}

                    For example, Owner applies visual AI to optimize food
                    images, because the data shows that vibrant pictures lead to
                    30% more sales:

                    will enable hyper-personalized recommendations for menu

                    They want solutions to the problems they encounter day to
                    day. AI agents will be able to find many of those solutions
                    within seconds. They’ll even be able to anticipate many of

                  </p>
                  <p>Here are some examples.</p>

                  <p>
                    Restaurant owners endlessly ask: “How do I reduce food cost
                    and labor cost, without hurting quality?” For food, the
                    solution requires some calculations, including contribution
                    margin. For labor, it requires finding out the benchmarks of
                    similar restaurants. Restaurant owners don’t do these things
                    well on their own. But the AI CFO will have access to all of
                    their data, as well as all the benchmark data. It will be
                    able to perform these real-time calculations and advise the
                    owner accordingly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>AI CMO:</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Restaurant owners want to share news and stories with their
                    customers. But they struggle to find the words. Many speak
                    English as a second language. Now, they’ll be able to ask
                    the CMO to deliver the news. It will write professional copy
                    within seconds. The AI CMO will also be able to anticipate
                    opportunities to increase sales, such as upcoming holidays.
                    It will proactively draft campaigns to pursue those
                    opportunities.

                    takes technical know-how to monitor the technical landscape
                    and make the relevant updates. But now, the AI CTO will be
                    able to constantly update the restaurant app’s user
                    experience and restaurant’s web user experience. It will
                    also be able to answer more tech-support related questions
                    automatically. For example, an owner might ask: “How do I
                    update my online hours to reflect our new breakfast menu?”
                    The AI CTO would respond: “I updated it on our website and
                    every online directory for us. This looks like it could lead
                    to a 21% jump in business, based on search volumes for that
                    keyword!”

                  <p>
                    The AI executives will have a natural-language interface.
                    The interface will start with text chat. Eventually, it will
                    be possible to call an AI executive on the phone.

                  <h3>Net Churn and Net Revenue Retention</h3>
                  <p>
                    Net Revenue Retention is one of the most important metrics
                    for Owner’s growth. Because Owner serves SMBs, Owner has a
                    higher rate of logo churn than an enterprise SaaS company
                    that serves large corporations. But Owner is counteracting
                    logo churn with expansion revenue from the customers that
                    succeed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, when our customers' restaurants sales volume
                    grows or when they add new locations, their payments volume
                    increases, this flows through Owner and grows Owner’s
                    revenue.

                  <p>
                    Logo churn is inevitable for businesses that serve SMBs. For
                    example, a large portion of Owner’s churn in January 2025
                    was due to restaurant closures. Despite these dynamics,
                    Owner already has best-in-className retention metrics for
                    the restaurant technology category.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As the Owner product gets better and better at driving
                    success for restaurants, our ability to counteract churn
                    with expansion revenue will get even better.

                    <strong>
                      More than 1,000 customers have switched to Owner from

                  <p>
                    Owner isn’t a good fit for restaurant owners who care more
                    about creative control than performance. Those customers are
                    best served by BentoBox, Squarespace, or consultants. Owner
                    also isn’t a good fit for those who just want to get the
                    word out about their restaurant. They are best served by
                    DoorDash and Uber Eats.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Owner’s customers care more about performance than creative
                    control. They don’t want to have to fiddle with
                    customizations. They want the work done for them. That’s

                  <p>
                    Yes. Owner integrates with Toast, Square, and

                  <p>
                    These POS systems are designed for operational efficiency
                    within the restaurant. They unify front of house and back of

                  <p>
                    As a result, restaurant owners can get the best of both

                    <strong>What are competitors missing?</strong>
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    There are two reasons why Owner is seeing success against
                    its competition.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  <ol role="list">
                    <li>
                      Competitors took their products in a different
                      direction—favoring customization. Restaurant owners see
                      “yet another tool to figure out.”&nbsp;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Competitors lock customers into long-term contracts, then
                      use unnecessarily aggressive tactics during collections.
                      This feels unfair to restaurant owners who are struggling,
                      or feel like they haven't gotten any value. Restaurants
                      are hard enough without competitors collecting their fees
                      by any means necessary. We’ve heard stories of them using
                      ACH debits, collection agencies, and other extreme means
                      to collect. Restaurant owners HATE this.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    In contrast, Owner doesn’t lock customers into long-term
                    contracts. Owner offers month-to-month billing only, because
                    we insist on earning restaurant owner’s business every
                    month. It’s the ultimate incentive alignment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Interestingly, another competitor category that Owner
                    frequently replaces is marketing consultants. Restaurant
                    owners often feel that their software stack is complicated
                    to manage. So they try to hire consultants to do SEO,
                    website building, and more. They spend over $1,000 a month
                    on average on consultants. But Owner’s AI replaces the work
                    of a consultant. Owner is cheaper, more effective, and more
                    measurable than hiring a consultant.&nbsp;

                    The Owner vision has always stretched beyond restaurants.

                  <p>
                    It started with a local dog grooming business owned by
                    Adam’s mom. She felt much like Sarkis: defenseless against
                    her own Goliath, which was Petco. But she secured victory
                    after being armed with the first version of Owner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Owner aims to secure that same victory for every local
                    business owner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Owner started by pursuing independent restaurant owners
                    because the field was big enough. Restaurants could provide
                    the revenue, scale, data, and resources<em> </em>to serve as
                    the proving ground for the big vision.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The story has unfolded exactly as written. Owner is already
                    seeing strong signals of demand from other verticals, like
                    salons, pet care, spas, gyms, florists, and auto shops.
                    Owner will pursue them sequentially based on market pull.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Owner system would be extremely useful to each of those
                    business types, and they already want it.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The same dynamics that apply to restaurants apply to them,
                    too. The fates of these offline businesses are being
                    determined by their online presence.&nbsp;

                  <p>
                    How good is the website, mobile app, SEO, digital marketing,
                    online pick-up/delivery of your local florist, indie grocer,
                    or salon?

                    Today, Owner is building AI to personalize and optimize the
                    system for each business type, based on the data it
                    collects. Over time, Owner will arm all local business
                    owners with their very own AI CTO, CMO, and CFO.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is how Owner will become the company all local business
                    owners rely on to win in the future ahead. Every local
                    business owner dreams of being able to hire a marketing
                    leader, technology leader, and finance leader. None of them
                    can afford it. So the platform, over time, will evolve to be
                    their AI CMO, CTO, and CFO. It will be trained on the data
                    and best practices of thousands of that exact business type.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Owner will give tens of millions of local business owners
                    the system to take on the large corporate Goliaths.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By strengthening millions of local businesses, Owner will
                    grow into a mighty enterprise.

                      You can see this most clearly in restaurants. Just 20
                      years ago, 60% of the restaurant world was owned by
                      independent mom-and-pops. Today, that number is 40% and
                      dropping by the year. National and global chains keep
                      taking over, while local restaurants keep shutting down.

                    <p>
                      Owner might look like an overnight success. I’m a
                      25-year-old CEO of a billion-dollar company.&nbsp;
                    </p>

                      I never thought I would be able to raise venture capital.
                      We were rejected from YC twice. We were rejected by dozens
                      of investors in the first 3 years. We were rejected by
                      hundreds of customers. Across the last seven years,
                      rejections have outnumbered every achievement.

                      Investors have valued us at $1B, but our job isn’t
                      finished. When venture investors assign a $1B valuation,
                      they’re not saying the company today is worth $1B. They’re
                      saying it has real potential to be a $10B company. We
                      still have to prove them—and the thousands of small
                      business owners betting on us—right.

                      the biggest companies in small business software. We
                      didn’t come this far just to come this far.

                      have a long way to go. I feel blessed to have some of the
                      world’s best people at my side for this phase. Every
                      person on the Owner team is truly great.
