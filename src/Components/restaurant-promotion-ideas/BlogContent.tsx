                  strategies they’ve used to grow consistently — month in and
                  month out — with many achieving their goal of expanding to

                  warmer months. Places to set up a small pop-up restaurant

                  It’s a terrific restaurant promotion, as it’s only a
                  short-term investment, and you get a brand new audience to try

                  here at Owner.com. These types of campaigns work for every
                  restaurant and customer type. The key is to run ads with
                  strong copywriting that grabs attention and asks the user a
                  question the customer will answer “yes” to in their head:

                </ul>
                <p>
                  You also want to create some urgency by saying the quantity of
                  offers is limited and on a first-come, first-serve basis, AND
                  the promotion will only run for a limited time.

                <p>
                  From there, it’s all about upselling discount customers into
                  bigger order values, which our checkout system does for you
                  automatically and very effectively.

                  While the net sales from this campaign were great on their
                  own, this only represents a fraction of the campaign’s
                  success. The restaurant now has 2,400 people to reach out to
                  with additional offers, AND a large chunk of those 841
                  customers are very likely to return.

                  The reach you get from offering a compelling promotion goes
                  far beyond the actual people who walk in and redeem the deal.

                  <strong>15. Mix Things Up With a Secret Menu&nbsp;</strong>
                </h2>
                <p>
                  How about creating a secret menu item? You know, something
                  special that only the insiders know about. This could be a
                  unique dish that's only available upon request for those in
                  the know. It creates a sense of exclusivity and excitement,
                  encouraging customers to come back to discover what's new and
                  hidden.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                  Try promoting it through word-of-mouth, social media posts, or
                  even by leaving subtle hints around your restaurant. It's a
                  fun way to engage your customers and keep them intrigued about
                  what other surprises your restaurant has in store.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Example: </strong>In-N-Out brands are that their
                  public menu is incredibly small and simple, AND their “secret”
                  menu is well-documented and accepted seamlessly by staff the
                  same as the public menu.&nbsp;

                  This is how you make a secret menu feel special. It’s treated
                  like a normal menu BUT you only find out about it if a regular
                  at the restaurant tells you about it or you see it being
                  talked about in online communities.

                <h2>
                  <strong>16. Create a Limited-Run Menu Item</strong>
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Promotions are all about getting customers to take action, and
                  few things motivate action quite like a deadline. Limited-run
                  menu items are an ideal promotion strategy for several
                  reasons:
                </p>
                <ul role="list">
                  <li>
                    They get people in the door{" "}
                    <a
                      href="https://www.owner.com/blog/average-restaurant-profit-margin"
                      target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    >
                      without losing margin
                    </a>{" "}
                    to discounts.
                  </li>
                  <li>They let you more easily experiment with your menu.</li>
                  <li>They play well on social media.</li>
                  <li>You can use them to pick up local media coverage.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Regularly offering limited-run items also opens the doors for
                  additional promotions down the road. You can run polls
                  allowing customers to vote on which items to bring back (and
                  possibly make voting a perk of your loyalty program), or you
                  can simply take popular items and give them an encore.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Example: </strong>Shake Shack regularly introduces new
                  and innovative menu items for a limited time, such as special
                  burgers, shakes, or desserts. One time, they partnered with
                  Milk Bar to create unique shakes made with Milk Bar’s baked
                  goods. &nbsp;
                </p>
                <h2>
                  <strong>17. Offer a Special Menu</strong>
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Offering a special menu for the pets and/or kids your
                  customers bring with them is a great way to show care and
                  thoughtfulness and connect emotionally with your customers.
                  These menus and any little freebies or specials you attach
                  with them make for an evergreen source of promotion as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Brands that connect on an emotional level tend to get more
                  word-of-mouth marketing from their customers, and while there
                  are certainly other ways to create an emotional connection,
                  it’s hard to imagine anything easier or more reliable than
                  simply creating a dedicated menu that caters to the most
                  important little beings in someone’s life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Example: </strong>The Presley offers a{" "}

                  , featuring a “Puppuccino”, different fresh meat options, and
                  a “Presley Pawtner Bowl” that includes carrots, cauliflower,
                  sweet potato, and spinach. They’re likely to draw in many
                  pet-lover customers with this simple yet thoughtful
                  addition.&nbsp;

                  </strong>
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Offering small freebies is a staple promotion strategy, but
                  it’s not going to make you go viral. If you want to really
                  stand out, you need to offer something big. How big?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Well, Chick-fil-A grew to be one of the largest privately held
                  companies in the world by offering a full year of free food to
                  the first 100 visitors to each new location.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every time a new location opened, people would camp out in the
                  nights leading up to the opening, hoping to be one of the
                  winners. This phenomenon was frequently covered by local press
                  and resulted in millions of dollars in free advertising over
                  the years.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Example: </strong>McDonald's has run various
                  Monopoly-themed promotions over the years where customers can
                  win cash prizes, cars, vacations, and other valuable items by
                  collecting game pieces from their food purchases.
