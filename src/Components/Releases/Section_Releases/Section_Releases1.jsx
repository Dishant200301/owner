                <h2>Spy on competitors for free</h2>

                <h2>Fix costly errors in your online presence</h2>
                <p>Beyond competitors, the grader identifies errors in your online profiles—missing keywords,
                  incomplete details, or unoptimized content—so you can fix them and recover lost sales
                  opportunities.</p>
